# README

Simple Laravel PHP framework installation with PHP5 and composer installed and exposed to PATH variable. No webserver is included to serve the files (Apache, Nginx,...) the idea for this image is to be as simple as possible from the Laravel application point of view.

WebServers and such can be included in own personal images built from this repository.
